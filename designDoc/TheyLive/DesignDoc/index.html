            The goal for this project is to create a game where the player feels like they are in control of Roddy Piper 
            in the world of They Live. <br>
            The current overview: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Stating 'hub' location of the street/kiosk where Piper first puts on the glasses.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        the player will be unarmed
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            weapons are to be procured from enemies, in missions, and from exploration of open zone
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            can talk to any non-alien. they give some directional dialogue. Non-aliens wearing glasses give a mission.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            After some amount of time eliminating exclusively aliens, someone in glasses will come up to you to give you a mission or tells you about a meet up.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    isolated <a href="notes.html#Locations">areas</a> for discrete missions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    the game will end when the player has obtained a communication watch (used by aliens) and uses it.
                </li>
            </ul>
