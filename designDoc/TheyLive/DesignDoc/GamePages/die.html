<p> <b>What was good/interesting?</b> </p>
<ul>
    They did a good job with the aesthetic and design to evoke the film. I think even if you didn't know this was a game based on the film Die Hard, a player would be able to realise that on their own.
    <ul>
        <li>
            Character model was good (tank top, no shoes)
        </li>
        <li>
            starting and ending mission with elevator and alkways referring to the floor the player is on
        </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
    However the gameplay and tone that creates is very different that the film creating some dissonance. The gameplay is very fast and you're mowing through people 
    which is obviously very different form the slow pace and stealth like elements of the film.
</ul>

        On-Rails Shooter

            <li>
                Considering how different the gameplay is to They Live and that I've not seen Die Hard 2, I don't feel like analysing this is neccessary.
