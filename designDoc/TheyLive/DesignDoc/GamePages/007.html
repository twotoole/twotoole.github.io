<p></p>

<p> <b>What was good/interesting?</b> </p>
<ul>
    <li>
        there is a clear 2 item system where R1/2 select a weapon, and L1/2 select a contextual item  (e.g. cufflinks, fingerprint, healthpack)
    </li>
    <li>
        the setup for each mission seems intriguing and different. However the level generally plays out the same.
    </li>
</ul>


<p> <b>How can this influence They Live</b> </p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Every item could be very important
        <ul>
            <li>
                you have to do something specific in a mission to get the goggles -> the goggles influence how you take on a future mission
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
