<h3>Outline</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        The goal of this game is to make an open level based on 0:32:25 (Puts on glasses for the first time) - 0:43:34 (Flees the bank) of They Live (1988).
    </li>
    <li>
        I want to stay as faithful to the universe of They Live, while also expanding on it's ideas in order to make what could be one level in a Larger they Live game.
    </li>
    <li>
        I'm planning this to be a 3rd person Action/Adventure style game, with the main gameplay inspiration from Deus Ex (2000) and Hitman (2016).
    </li>
    <li>
        The current gameplay goal is to present the player with deifferent options on how to move through the level, using combat, dialogue and exploration.
    </li>
    <li>
        This document is intended to be a work in progress, so the goals outlined in the previous points are expected to evolve with the development.
    </li>
