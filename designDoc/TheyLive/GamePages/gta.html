<b>Notes</b>
<ul>
    Probably not going to go too in depth, just look at mission flow and open world.    <br>

    <li>
        The cars are a fundamental difference, allowing for a bigger space. It's also supposed to be fun to drive
        so the simple go there and do this mission structure is understandalble as going there should be fun by itself.
    </li>
    <li>
        The mission stucture definitely gets more intereting through each iteration, but the vehicles are so fundamentle to the experience that it's probably better to looke elsewhere for They Live inspiration.
    </li>

    <li><b>GTA3</b></li>
    <li>
        opening cutscene (in world), but then the game starts with a mission
        <ul>
            <li>
                Control tutorial pops up in top left corner. Seems contextual (i.e. will instruct you on how to do what you're currently doing)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        pop up repeated for a mission instruction (stop in the centre of the blue marker), did not repeat car controls.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Missions are basic go there do this. get money reward. Mission ~4 Ammu-Nation is introduced.
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>Not sure how much making notes on these gameplay videos will help, as it's very hard to demonstrate open world feel through a video, especially the videos chosen here.</ul>

<br>
<p>

<p> <b>What was good/interesting?</b> </p>
<ul>
    I think the in engine cutscene are vital in feeling immered in the open world.
