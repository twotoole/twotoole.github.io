    <li>
        Order of what to implemnt.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Unarmed:    move -> aim/target -> attack
            </li>
            <li>
                armed:      move -> pickup weapon -> aim/target -> shoot
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    so, the order to do things is make sure moving is good -> make sure aiming and targeting is good -> then figure out picking up weapons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    the attack button should work univerally and run a attack function which if unarmed defaults to a punch, but if not unarmed then run attack function on equiped weapon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    unarmed is a weapon as it shows in the inve3ntory as a hand, but you obviously don't need to pick it up.
                </li>

                change weapons
            </li>
            <li>
                Talk to NPC's
                <li>
                    Main NPC's have dialogue trees, extra NPC's do the RDR2 thing
                </li>

</ul>

<li><b>Inventory</b></li>
<li>
    is the inventory a scriptable object?<br>
    If it is, then Player has a Script called Inventory that takes a SO of an inventory <br>
    if done like this then NPC's will be able to have an inventory <br>
    So PlayerInventory has a list of gameObjects?
</li>

<li>
    first we need to make sure player has weapon -> hits attack button -> weapon attacks
</li>
<li>
    so, you want a class of weapon, which has the function attack, but each attack is different, so base class is abstract, <br>
    and each derived class (e.g. M16), has a SO called M16 in which we write the shooting script. 
    <li>
        so each weapon needs a name, an object and an attack
    </li>
</li>

<li>
    need to figure out inventory wraparound (done);

            should be simple enough

    Pinned notable locations from the scene on a map of LA. This is to aid in the level design. <br>

<li>
    Found area within a 3D model of downtown LA, and placed in scene. This is also to aid in level design, while trying to stay close to the source material.

        <li>
            Need to change the way the material is changed on the Adverts.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    current system requires creating a new changeMaterial object and assigning the textures (e.g. OBEY/Pepsi)
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            this will end up in too many unique objects
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    We need to create a prefab that takes two textures and a script that will assign the textures to a parent object.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            this can probably just be dont by editing the "Change Material" script to take two materials instead of the scriptable object.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
